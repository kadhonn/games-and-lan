                    Have you ever wondered how a different reality would feel like? Then you are at the right place! If
                    you ever wanted to
                    cut stuff in a rythm (Beat Saber), shoot things in bullettime (SUPERHOT) or disarm bombs with
                    friends (Keep talking and nobody explodes),
                    everything is possible with a VR-Set! For that we provide you with a HTC Vive and a Oculus Rift.

                            Weird question for a gaming night, but I’ll answer it. We do not offer it, but if you bring
                            the official permits, your own equipment and a permit of the buildings owner, find a
                            suitable location to do so and do it on your own liability, there is nothing we can do to
                            stop you even though we advice against it.
                        </p>
